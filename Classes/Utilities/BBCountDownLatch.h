/**
 A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other
 threads completes.
 
 This class was largely inspired by
 [Java's CountDownLatch](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html),
 built using GCD and a block-friendly API.
 
 It is an extremely useful class when you have multiple things happening at the same time and you need to make sure a
 piece of code doesn't run until all of them are finished. It can either be waiting for multiple worker threads to
 finish off some parallel computation or multiple UI animations that have arbitrary durations and need to properly
 finish before starting some other animation (synchronized chaining).
 
 ## Using a count down latch
 
     BBCountDownLatch* latch = [BBCountDownLatch autoCleanupLatchWithName:@"test" counter:2 andCompletionBlock:^{
         NSLog(@"Released!");
     }];
 
     // On worker thread #1
     [latch countDownWithCalledId:@"worker #1"];
 
     // On worker thread #2
     [latch countDownWithCalledId:@"worker #2"];
 
 The above code will always result in a log statement being printed out to the console after both workers perform the
 countdown, no matter the order in which they call it or how long each of them takes.

 When counter count downs are performed, the completion block passed to the instance during creation is executed **on
 the main queue**.
 
 This execution is thread safe and serialized, i.e. a single thread will be able to perform the logic in this method at
 once. This guarantees that exactly counter count downs are required to trigger the completion block.
 
 If logging macros are set and enabled, passing a `callerId` when performing a count down will log the id of the caller.
 This is especially useful for debugging, to figure out which workers have (or have not) performed the count down.
 
 @param callerId Identifier for the worker that triggered a count down.

 Useful if the number of block executions is not known at the time of creation of the latch, such as when you need to 
 pass the latch to an arbitrary number of workers.

 @warning Caution, here be dragons.
 
 Resetting a latch after operations with it have already begun will likely lead to
 inconsistent behavior, causing the block to be released earlier than expected or not released at all! Make sure you
 **know exactly what you're doing** when calling this method.
